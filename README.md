To run the app, first run Gradle Sync by clicking the elephant with arrow icon in the top right of the Android studio window and wait for it to complete.

You will need to install an emulator on Android to run the app. For this you'll need to:

Open the Device Manager manager (click the phone icon in the top right of your Android Studio window)

Click on + → "Create Virtual Device..."

Select any Phone from the list and click Next.

Select system image. You’ll need to choose an Android API version that is compatible with both the app and the device (if you can't see one under the 'Recommended' tab, look under the 'Other images' tab). Note that you will need to install it before you can select it.

To run your code, simply press the 'play' button in Android Studio, with your virtual device selected.
